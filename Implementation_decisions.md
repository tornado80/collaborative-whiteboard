We treat the canvas as several abstract layers on top of each other.

Only one layer is the ink layer which stores the points as a result of drawing on the canvas.

Other layers correspond to the movable objects (sticky notes, comments, images) based on their Z-value.

A drawing is erased partly not as a whole!

> TODO: Discuss about how to show comments on images and how to model it in our app!
